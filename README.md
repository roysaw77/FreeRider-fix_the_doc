## Fix the Docs: Smarter, Faster, Maintainable Documentation for the Real World by iFAST
### CONTEXT
In real-world tech environments, documentation is a critical but broken part of the software development lifecycle.

-Writing it is slow, repetitive, and often skipped.
-Reading it is painful and time-consuming, especially for new joiners.
-Maintaining it is impractical in fast-changing systems — documentation quickly becomes outdated, misleading, or irrelevant.

This leads to onboarding delays, wasted engineering time, and avoidable bugs — all due to poor or outdated docs.

### YOUR CHALLENGE
Design and build a smart documentation assistant/tool that improves how technical documentation is created, consumed, and maintained in evolving software environments.

You don’t have to solve everything. Focus on at least two of the following dimensions:

<ins>**Focus Areas (Pick 2+)**</ins>
1. <ins>Simplify Writing</ins>
   - Auto-generate starter docs from code, git commits, or comments
   - Templates or AI suggestions to make writing faster
   - Real-time writing assistants or markdown validators

2. <ins>Speed Up Reading</ins>
   -Summarization tools (e.g., TL;DR for long docs)
   -Q&A search: Ask a question, get an answer (like ChatGPT for docs)
   -Visualizations (flow diagrams, API call graphs, changelogs)

3. <ins>Make Maintenance Easy</ins>
   -Detect stale documentation (doc drift vs. code)
   -Notify users when dependent components change
   -Auto-suggest doc updates from diffs or pull requests

**Deliverables (for 3-month scope)**
-Functional prototype (web app, CLI tool, plugin, or bot)
-Demo of real-world use (sample repo, API, or documentation system)
-GitHub repo with code + brief README
-Presentation/pitch (with a problem-solution-product flow)
